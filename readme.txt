We need to install environment for React.js(Javascript Library) which is our frontend.

Our Frontend Directory is mahalxmiecomm
Our Backend Directory is backend1

To start a React app, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Install Node.js: Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the process.

2. Install create-react-app: Open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

   This will install the create-react-app command globally on your system, allowing you to easily create new React projects.


3. Start the app: Once the app has been created, navigate into the frontend directory by typing:

   Go to the location of the unzipped folder
   ```
   cd mahalxmiecomm
   ```

   Then start the app by running:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a development server at localhost:3000 and the app will be visible in your default browser

We need to install environment for Django (Python Framework) which is our Backend


To create a Django REST framework project environment, you'll need to install Python and Django on your computer. Here are the steps to get started:

	Install Python: Go to the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to complete the process.

	Install Django: Once you've installed Python, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command to install Django:


	```
 	pip install django	
	```
	
	This will install the latest stable version of Django on your system.

	Install Django REST framework: Django REST framework is a third-party package that makes it easy to build RESTful APIs with Django. To install it, type the following command:

	```
 	pip install djangorestframework	
	```
	```
	cd backend1
	```
	For our backend apis to work we need to start our server run the command
	Open the terminal

	'''
	python manage.py runserver

	'''

Now on localhost:3000 we can see our app being fully functional
